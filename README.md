# UFood Data Analyst Case
UFood is the lead food delivery app in Brazil, present in over a thousand cities.
Keeping a high customer engagement is key for growing and consolidating the company’s
position as the market leader.

Data Analysts working within the data team are constantly challenged to provide insights and
value to the company through open scope projects. This case intends to simulate that.

In this case, you are presented a sample dataset, that mocks metainformation on the customer
and on UFood campaign interactions with that customer.

It is your challenge to understand the data, find business opportunities & insights and to propose
any data driven action to optimize the campaigns results & generate value to the company.
You should consider that you have to present your results to both technical and business
stakeholders.

## Key Objectives are:
1. Explore the data – don’t just plot means and counts. Provide insights, define cause and
effect. Provide a better understanding of the characteristic features of respondents

2. Propose and describe a customer segmentation based on customers behaviors

3. Visualize data and provide written reasoning behind discoveries

## The Company
Consider a well-established company operating in the retail food sector. Presently they have
around several hundred thousands of registered customers and serve almost one million
consumers a year. 

They sell products from 5 major categories: 
- Wines
- Rare meat products
- Exotic fruits
- Specially prepared fish 
- Sweet products

These can further be divided into gold and
regular products. 

The customers can order and acquire products through 3 sales channels: physical
stores, catalogs and company’s website. 

Globally, the company had solid revenues and a healthy
bottom line in the past 3 years, but the profit growth perspectives for the next 3 years are not
promising... For this reason, several strategic initiatives are being considered to invert this
situation. **One is to improve the performance of marketing activities, with a special focus on
marketing campaigns.**


#### The Marketing Department
The marketing department was pressured to spend its annual budget more wisely. Desirably, the success
of these activities will prove the value of the approach and convince the more skeptical within the
company


# OVERALL FINDINGS
**Age:** Tended to show that ages 30 to 70 were spending more money but were less likely to accept campaigns. Much higher volumn here though.

**Type of Purchase:** Catalog was more likely to accept campaigns, but In-Person mediums like Stores spend much more. Recommend a split between all. Maybe 40% catalog, 30% store, and 30% web.

**Kids at Home:** Very high negative correlation between people with kids and spending money/accepting campaigns. Recommend focusing on people with no/less kids.

**Education Level:** No impact noticed. No need to target any group.

**Marital Status:** Doesn't play a huge role. Married, Single, and Together spend more money. Widows are more likely to accept a campaign.

### Money Making Recommendations
- Middle aged people, high earners, with no kids. Target on different platforms with split above.
- New Users to Spend Money
- Focus on 21-30 and 70+ age groups who statistically accepted campaigns at a higher rate.
